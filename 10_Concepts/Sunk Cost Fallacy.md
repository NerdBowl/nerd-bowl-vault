### Sunk Cost Fallacy
The [[Sunk Cost]] Fallacy is a deviation from [[Rational Choice Theory]] wherein agents allow non-recoverable costs (costs already incurred) to influence current decision-making. According to the rational choice model, decisions should be based solely on future costs and benefits; historical costs that are invariant across all future options should be ignored.

This fallacy is explained through [[Mental Accounting]] and the [[Prospect Theory|Asymmetric Value Function]].
