### Mental Accounting
Mental Accounting is the cognitive process by which individuals code, categorize and evaluate economic outcomes. It explains how people violate the principle of **fungibility** by treating money differently depending on its origin or intended use. 

[[Rational Choice Theory]] assumes all wealth is interchangeable. Mental accounting suggests people assign funds to specific labels, and are reluctant to transfer funds between them

**Framing of gains and losses**
- **Segregation:** People generally prefer to segregate gains (evaluate them separately) because the [[Prospect Theory|value function]] is concave ($V(x) + V(y) > V(x+y)$).
- **Integration:** People generally prefer to integrate losses to minimize pain, due to convexity in losses ($V(-x-y) > V(-x) + V(-y)$). In practice, people do separate losses, leading to sub-optimal choices. 

**[[Sunk Cost]]s:** Mental accounting leads people to "track" costs in a specific account. Closing an account with a negative balance (realizing a loss) is painful, leading to the **[[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]** (e.g., wearing tight shoes because they were expensive).
