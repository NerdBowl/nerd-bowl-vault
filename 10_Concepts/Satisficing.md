### Satisficing
**Satisficing** is a decision-making strategy where an individual sets an aspiration level or threshold and selects the first option that meets this threshold, rather than searching the entire feasible set to find the global maximum. 

This is a more simplistic way of searching than proposed in [[Search Theory]].

The threshold is selected based on a heuristic. Having a good heuristic allows for getting a relatively good outcome with minimal effort.
