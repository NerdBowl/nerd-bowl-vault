### Evolutionary Game Theory
Evolutionary [[Game Theory]] applies the principles of biological evolution to the analysis of strategic interactions and preferences. Unlike standard rational choice models where tastes are exogenous (given arbitrarily), evolutionary theory posits that preferences are functional mechanisms forged by natural selection to solve specific environmental problems.

In this framework, a specific "taste" or behavioral strategy is viewed as a means to achieve material objectives (survival and reproduction) rather than an end in itself.

#### Core Principles
- **Adaptive Rationality:** Tastes are not random; they are adaptations that increased the survival probability of ancestors.
- **Strategic Preferences:** While simple tastes (e.g., preference for sweets) benefit an individual regardless of others' actions, strategic preferences are those where the usefulness depends on the population frequency of other types (e.g., aggression or altruism).
- **Environmental Context:** A preference that is adaptive in one environment (scarcity) may become maladaptive in another (abundance) if the environment changes faster than evolution can adapt.
