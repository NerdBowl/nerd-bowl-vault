### Self-Interest Standard
The self-interest standard assumes that an agent's motives are strictly congruent with their narrow material interests. In standard micro-economic research, this is the dominant assumption. 

The standard explicitly excludes motives such as [[Altruism|altruism]], fidelity to principle, desire for justice, or the welfare of others. 
This standard fails to predict behaviors such as:
- Leaving tips for waiters
- Walking away from profitable, but 'unfair' scenarios
- Seeking revenge at a ruinous personal cost
- Voting in large elections (high time waste, low impact / reward)
