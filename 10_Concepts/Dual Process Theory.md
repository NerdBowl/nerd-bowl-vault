### Dual Process Theory
Dual Process Theory is a psychological framework utilized to describe two distinct modes of cognitive processing that drive human behavior. These are typically categorized as System 1 (intuition) and System 2 (Reasoning).

#### System 1
This is fast, automatic, instinctive, emotional and uncontrolled decion making. Fast reactions are given, and frame decision for System 2. 
It is heavily influenced by framing and context.

#### System 2
This is a slower process of decision making. It takes effort, it conscious and analytical. Complex calculations are handled, comparisons between scenarios are made and rationality is introduced. 
Does not happen automatically, you have to actively do this.

#### Interaction
System 1 may conflict with System 2. System 1 often determines the frame or default setting that System 2 then analyzes, potentially biasing the final output.
