### Social Dilemma
A social dilemma is a situation where individual [[Rational Choice Theory|rational]] incentives conflict with collective efficiency. Specifically, individuals have a dominant strategy to "defect" (act selfishly), even though mutual cooperation would yield higher returns for all participants.

#### Properties
- **Dominant Strategy:** Holding the other player's behavior fixed, a player always maximizes their own payoff by defecting.
- **Suboptimal Outcome:** When all agents follow their rational dominant strategy, the outcome is worse than if they had cooperated.

For mututal cooperation in these social dilemmas, cooperators must be able to distinguish other cooperators from defectors, using [[Signalling Theory]].
