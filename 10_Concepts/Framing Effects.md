### Framing Effects
Framing effects occur when an agent's decisions are influenced by the way identical information is presented (framed). This constitutes a violations of the Invariance [[Consumer Preferences#Axioms of Rational Choice|axiom of Rational Choice]], which dictates that preferences should not depend on the description of the options. 

#### Mechanism
Framing triggers [[Dual Process Theory#System 1|System 1 ]] processing which is sensitive to whether outcomes are described as [[Prospect Theory|gains or losses relative to a reference point]].
- Gain-Frame: induces risk-averse behavior
- Loss Frame: induces risk-seeking behavior
