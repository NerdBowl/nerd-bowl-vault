### Market Disequilibrium
Market Disequilibrium occurs when the price differs from the [[10_Concepts/Market Equilibrium|equilibrium price]]. In this state, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, meaning one side of the market is dissatisfied. 

#### Types of Disequilibrium
##### Excess Supply (surplus)
In this situation, the price is higher than the equilibrium price. 
Trading is limited by buyer's demand. Sellers are dissatisfied, because they wish to sell more units than buyers are willing to purchase at that price. 

**Adjusting**
- Sellers hold unsold stock, which represents an opportunity cost.
- Mechanism: sellers have an incentive to undercut competitors. A seller assumes that by lowering the price slightly below the current market price, they can sell their accumulated surplus. 
- Result: Downward pressure on price persists until $P=P^*$
##### Excess Demand (Shortage)
The market price lies below the equilibrium value. Trading is limited by seller's supply. Buyers are dissatisfied because the wish to purchase more units than sellers are willing top provide at that price. 

**Adjusting**
- Buyers are unable to satisy their demand. 
- Buyers begin bidding against one another, offering higher prices to secure the scarce goods. 
- Results in upward pressure on price until $P=P*$
