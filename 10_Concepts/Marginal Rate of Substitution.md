### Marginal Rate of Substitution
The **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)** is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at any given point. It represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to exchange one good for another while maintaining the same level of satisfaction.
$$MRS = \left| \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} \right|$$
- **Marginal Benefit:** The MRS can be interpreted as the marginal benefit of Good X expressed in terms of Good Y.
- **Diminishing MRS:** As one moves downward along an indifference curve (increasing X, decreasing Y), the MRS declines. This reflects the **convexity** property: the more of Good X a consumer has, the less Good Y they are willing to sacrifice to acquire yet another unit of X.
