### Asymmetric Information
Asymmetric information is a condition where one party possesses greater or more accurate knowledge regarding the relevant facts. This imbalance allows the better-informed part to potentially exploit the information gap. 

### Asymmetric Information in economics
The exploitation of the information gap between parties can lead to market inefficiencies or market failures. 

In standard economics modelling, this is often treated as a deviation from the assumption of perfect information found in classical competitive equilibrium models. 

**Properties & Dynamics**
- **Nature of Asymmetry:** The uncertainty can stem from "Nature" (stochastic events outside control) or from the strategic choices of agents .    
- **Strategic Control:** When agents have control over uncertainty (e.g., effort levels, precautionary measures), conflicts of interest arise between the informed and uninformed parties.
- **Monitoring Costs:** The fundamental friction driving asymmetric information problems is the prohibitive cost or inability of one party to perfectly monitor the actions or attributes of the other.
