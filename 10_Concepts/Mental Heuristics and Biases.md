### Mental Heuristics and Biases
Heuristics and Biases refer to the framework identifying systematic derivations from rational judgement. **Heuristics** are simple, efficient rules of thumb that people use to form judgements and make decisions. **Biases** are the predictable, systematic errors that result from the reliance on these heuristics. 

Heuristics are generally useful; they economize on cognitive effort and provide roughly correct answers in many situations. 
Unlike random errors, biases caused by heuristics are predictable and directional. 

#### Availability Heuristic
The availability Heuristic is a judgement rule where the frequency or probability of an event is estimated by the ease with which instanced or associations can be brought to mind.

Often effective because frequent evens are typically easier to recall.

However, bias can occur due to vividness/sensationalism (dramatic events are easier to recall), recency (recent events are eaier to recall, even though they might be mundane), and structure of retrieval (some things are easier to recall than others).

#### Representativeness Heuristics
The Representativeness Heuristic is a judgement rule where the probability that an object A belongs to class B is evaluated by the degree to which A resembles the stereotype of B, rather than by using probability logic ([[Bayes' Rule]]).

**Base Rate Neglect:** When judging likelihood based on similarity, individuals often ignore the base rate (prior) of the class in the population.

**Regression to the Mean:** The failure to recognize that extreme outliers are likely due to be followed by more average observations. People often attribute regression to causality rather than statistical inevitability. 

#### Anchoring and Adjustment
Anchoring and Adjustment is a strategy of estimation where people start with an initial value (the anchor) and then adjust away from it to reach a final answer. The bias occurs because the adjustments are typically insufficient, leaving the final estimate biased toward the initial anchor. 
- The initial anchor often has no logical relationship to the value being estimated.
- When estimating the probability of a complex system succeeding, people anchor on the high success of a single step, and insufficiently adjust for the number of steps.
