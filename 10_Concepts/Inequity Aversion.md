### Inequity Aversion
Inequity aversion is a [[Consumer Preferences|preference]] structure where utility is derived not just from absolute wealth, but from the **fairness** of the distribution of surplus.

Preferences are defined over:
1. **Absolute Wealth** ($M$).
2. **Relative Share** ($P/S$), where $P$ is the payment received and $S$ is the total surplus.

**Properties of Indifference Curves:**
- **Reference Point:** The "fair" division is typically defined as an equal split ($P/S = 0.5$).
- **Convexity (U-Shape):** Indifference curves in the ($P/S$, Wealth) plane are convex or U-shaped centered around 0.5.
    - _Interpretation:_ Utility declines as the ratio deviates from 0.5 in _either_ direction.
    - _Compensation Principle:_ To maintain constant utility, an agent must receive higher absolute wealth ($M$) to compensate for the disutility of accepting a share that deviates from equality.
