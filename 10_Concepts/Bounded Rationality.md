### Bounded Rationality
**Bounded Rationality** is the economic concept proposing that decision-makers possess limited cognitive resources, information, and time, preventing them from achieving the perfect utility maximization assumed in [[Rational Choice Theory]] models. Instead of optimizing, agents seek solutions that are sufficient given their constraints. This concept posits that it is often irrational to be completely well-informed due to the costs of information gathering and processing.
[[Search Theory]] is used to determine whether to keep searching or accept current best.
