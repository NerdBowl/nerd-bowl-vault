### Game Theory
#### Definition
Game Theory is the analytical framework used to study strategic interdependence between decision-makers. Game theory analyzes situations where the payoff to an action depends not only on the action itself but also on the actions taken by other participants in the same environment.

#### Strategic Interdependence
Strategic interdependence is a condition in decision-making environments where the satisfaction (utility or profit) of one agent is contingent upon the choices made by other agents.

#### Elements of a Game
All games consists of three essential elements:
- **Players:** The decision-makers involved in the interaction
- **The Strategies:** The complete list of possible actions or plans available to each player. 
- **The Payoffs:** The outcomes that correspond to every possible combination of strategies chosen by the players. 

#### Classification of Games
- **[[Normal Form Games|Simultaneous Games]]:** Players choose strategies at the same time without knowing the other's choice.
- **[[Extensive Form Games|Sequential Games]]:** Players move in turn, allowing later movers to observe previous actions.
- **Repeated Games:** Interactions that occur multiple times, allowing for strategies based on past history.
- **Games of Incomplete Information:** Situations where one or more agents lack knowledge about a salient point of the game, such as the opponent's payoff function or "type".
