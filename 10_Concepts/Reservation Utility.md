### Reservation Utility
**Reservation Price**
The threshold amount at which a person is indifferent between doing and not doing an activity.

**In Economics**
- For costs, it is the minimum amount one would accept to perform the action
- For benefits, it is the maximum amount one would pay to achieve the result

**In [[10_Concepts/Search Theory]]**
The acceptance wage ($w^*$) or reservation price ($P^*$) is the threshold value where the marginal cost of an additional search exactly equals the expected marginal benefit of that search.
