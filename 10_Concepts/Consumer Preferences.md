### Consumer Preferences
A Preference Ordering is a ranking scheme that enables a consumer to assess the relative desirability of any two bundles of goods. It allows the consumers to state whether one bundle is preferred over another, or if they are indifferent. 

This framework assumes Ordinal Utility, meaning consumers can rank order bundles but cannot quantitatively express how much more they prefer one to another. 

This concept is part of the [[Rational Choice Theory]].
#### Axioms of Rational Choice
Generally, five axioms of preference orderings are assumed to construct solvable models of choice:
1. **Completeness:** All possible combinations of goods and services should be ranked.
2. **Transitivity:** If $A>B$, and $B>C$, then $A>C$
3. **Monotonicity:** Other quantities staying equal, more of one good is preferred to less. 
4. **Continuity:** Similar bundles should rank similarly.
5. **Convexity:**  Mixtures of goods are preferred to extremes. If a consumer is indifferent between bundles A and B, they will prefer a weighted average (bundle C).
