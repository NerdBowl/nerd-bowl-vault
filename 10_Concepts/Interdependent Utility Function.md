### Interdependent Utility Function
An interdependent [[Utility Theory|utility function]] is a mathematical representation of preferences where an agent's utility is a function of their own wealth/consumption and the wealth/consumption of another agent.

$$U_S = f(M_S, M_J)$$
Where:
- $U_S$ is the utility of agent Smith.
- $M_S$ is the wealth of Smith.
- $M_J$ is the wealth of Jones.

It is simply the application of variables in a utility function that do not singularly directly forward ones self-interests.
