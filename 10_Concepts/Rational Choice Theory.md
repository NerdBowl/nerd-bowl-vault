### Rational Choice Theory
This is the framework to study how people choose under conditions of [[Scarcity]]. It posits that all individual purchase decisions are the result of a two-step optimization process:
1. **Defining the Feasible Set:** Identifying the various combinations of goods the consumer is able to buy given their income and market prices.
2. **Preference Maximization:** Selecting the specific bundle from the feasible set that the consumer prefers to all others.

The model assumes consumers enter the marketplace with well-defined preferences and act to allocate their incomes to best serve these preferences.
#### Standards of Rationality
- **[[Present-Aim Standard]]:** A broad definition where rationality is strictly the efficient pursuit of _whatever_ aims the agent holds at the moment of action, regardless of what those aims are.
- **[[Self-Interest Standard]] (Homo Economicus):** A narrower definition assuming motives are congruent with material interests, explicitly excluding altruism or moral sentiments.
#### As-if thesis
Economists do not assume people explicitly calculate costs and benefits for every action. Instead they assume people act as if they made such calculations. 

> Just as expert pool players obey the laws of physics without knowing the formal equations, people absorb the rules of rational decision-making through trial and error.

Economic models should be judged by how well they predict behaviour, not by the realism of their assumptions.
