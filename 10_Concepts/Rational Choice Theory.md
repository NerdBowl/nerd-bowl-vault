### Rational Choice Theory
This is the framework to study how people choose under conditions of [[Scarcity]]. It posits that all individual purchase decisions are the result of a two-step optimization process:
1. **Defining the Feasible Set:** Identifying the various combinations of goods the consumer is able to buy given their income and market prices.
2. **Preference Maximization:** Selecting the specific bundle from the feasible set that the consumer prefers to all others.

The model assumes consumers enter the marketplace with well-defined preferences and act to allocate their incomes to best serve these preferences.
#### Home Economicus
A stereotypical decision-maker in the self-interest model who cares only about personal material costs and benefits.
#### As-if thesis
Economists do not assume people explicitly calculate costs and benefits for every action. Instead they assume people act as if they made such calculations. 

> Just as expert pool players obey the laws of physics without knowing the formal equations, people absorb the rules of rational decision-making through trial and error.

Economic models should be judged by how well they predict behaviour, not by the realism of their assumptions.
