### Moral Hazard
Moral Hazard is a post-contractual phenomenon where an agent alters their behavior, typically by taking more risks, after entering an agreement that insulates them from the full consequences of their actions.

**Example**
Consider an agent deciding between a safe action (Garage) and a risky action (Street) for parking a car. If the agent is fully insured, and something happens to the car, he is fully reimbursed. Thus, there is no difference in finding an unsafe spot versus a safe spot, except for the cost of finding a safe spot. 
In this particular scenario, it is always easier to find an unsafe spot, which is more risky behavior. The expected utility of the unsafe action is higher than the safe action, due to a limiting factor on damage costs. 

#### Solutions
- **Deductibles/Co-pays:** Forcing the agent to bear a portion of the loss reintroduces an incentive to avoid risk.
- **Performance-Based Pay:** Tying remuneration to outcomes (e.g., profit) aligns the agent's utility with the principal's objectives.
