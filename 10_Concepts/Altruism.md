### Altruism in Economics
Altruism in economics is modeled as a willing to accept a reduction in own-consumption in return for an increase in another's consumption. 
#### Geometric Properties
- **[[Indifference Curves]]:** Plotted on a map of ($M_{own}$, $M_{other}$), altruistic indifference curves are negatively sloped, indicating a trade-off the agent is willing to make.
- **Diminishing [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]]:** The curves exhibit convexity. The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) diminishes, meaning the more income the agent has, the more they are willing to give up to help the other. Conversely, as the agent becomes poorer, they are less willing to give.
#### Optimal Income Transfer
The optimal transfer occurs where the agent's MRS between their income and the recipient's income equals the absolute value of the slope of the budget constraint.
- **Budget Constraint Slope:** Typically $-1$ (it costs €1 to transfer €1).
- **Tangency Condition:** Optimal transfer point is where $MRS = 1$ (assuming 1:1 transfer cost).
- **Corner Solutions:** If at the initial endowment point the $MRS < 1$ (the agent values keeping their euro more than the recipient getting it), the optimal transfer is zero. Negative gifts are generally impossible.
