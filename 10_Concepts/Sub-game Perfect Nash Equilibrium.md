### Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium
A Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium is a refinement of the [[Nash Equilibrium]] concept. A strategy profile is a SPNE iff the players' strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every sub-game of the original game. 

**Rationality Constraint:**
- Rationality must hold at **every decision point**.
- This distinguishes SPNE from a standard Nash Equilibrium, which may rely on "non-credible threats" -> Strategies that involve irrational behavior at decision nodes that are not reached in equilibrium.
