### Social Preferences
Social preferences refer to utility function where an agent's well-being is determined not only by their own material allocation, but also by the allocation, intentions, or well-being of others. This framework integrates 'unselfish' motivations, such as public spirit, [[Altruism]], and anger, into the standard [[Rational Choice Theory]]. 

These preferences are compatible with the [[Present-Aim Standard]], but incompatible with the [[Self-Interest Standard]]. They are often explained through [[Evolutionary Game Theory ]]as strategic preferences that solve commitment problems. 

These social preferences are calculated using [[Interdependent Utility Function]]s.
