### Utility Theory
Utility Theory posists that preferences can be represented by a mathematical function $U(X,Y)$, which assigns a numerical value to every possible consumption bundle. 

#### Ordinal vs. Cardinal Utility
- **Ordinal Utility:** The standard approach in modern microeconomics. The specific numerical values are arbitrary; only the **ranking** (order) of bundles matters. We can say Bundle A is preferred to Bundle B, but not "by how much".
- **Cardinal Utility:** Assumes the magnitude of utility difference is meaningful (e.g., "A provides twice as much satisfaction as B"). This is generally not required for solving standard consumer choice problems.
