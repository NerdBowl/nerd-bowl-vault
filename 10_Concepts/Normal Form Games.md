### Normal Form Games
A Normal Form Game (simultaneous move game) is a model of strategic interaction characterized by the [[10_Concepts/Game Theory#Elements of a Game|three fundamental elements of a game]].

In this framework, players effectively choose their strategies simultaneously, or in a manner where they must decide without knowledge of the specific strategy chosen by the other player(s). This distinguishes Normal Form Games from [[10_Concepts/Extensive Form Games|Sequential Games]].

In Normal Form Games, you can create a summary of all possible payoffs between two players using a [[10_Concepts/Payoff Matrix]].
