### Conspicuous Consumption
**Conspicuous Consumption** is the expenditure on observable goods and services primarily for the purpose of [[Signalling Theory|signalling]] wealth or ability to others, rather than for the intrinsic utility of the goods themselves. It functions as a signal of ability in markets where ability is highly correlated with income but difficult to observe directly.

#### Dynamics
- **Positional Goods:** These goods provide utility based on relative ranking (e.g., having a _better_ suit than the rival).
- **Prisoner's Dilemma/Inefficiency:** If all agents increase spending on conspicuous goods to maintain their relative signal, the ranking remains unchanged, but collective savings decrease. This is a socially inefficient outcome .
- **Correlation Requirement:** The signal works only if the consumption is positively correlated with the unobservable trait (ability/income).
