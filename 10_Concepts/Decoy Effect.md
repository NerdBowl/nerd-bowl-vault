### Decoy Effect
The **Decoy Effect** is a specific violation of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) [[Consumer Preferences#Axioms of Rational Choice|axiom of Rational Choice Theory]].
It occurs when the introduction of a third options (the decoy), which is dominated by one of the existing options but not the other, significantly increases the probability of the dominating option being chosen. 

**The Halo Effect**
The mechanism often attributed to the phenomenon is the Halo Effect. When an option dominates a decoy, the dominance relationship provides a clear cognitively easy comparison. This clarity endows the dominating option with a halo, making it appear more attractive to other complex, hard-to-compare alternatives. 
This is a kind of [[Mental Heuristics and Biases]].

This connects to the idea of [[Prospect Theory]], where relative gains / losses are more significant than absolute ones.
