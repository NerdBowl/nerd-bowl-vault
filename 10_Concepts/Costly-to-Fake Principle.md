### Costly-to-Fake Principle
The **Costly-to-Fake Principle** (related to the _Single-Crossing Property_ in formal game theory) states that for a [[Signalling Theory|signal]] to be credible, the cost of generating the signal must be strictly higher for "low-quality" agents than for "high-quality" agents. If the signal were costless or equally costly for all, low-quality agents would mimic it, rendering the signal uninformative.

### Dynamics
- **Credibility:** The differential cost structure acts as a barrier to entry for deception.
- **Strategic Value:** Observers can infer hidden attributes (quality, intent) based on the presence of the costly signal.
