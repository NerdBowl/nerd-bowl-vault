### Principal-Agent Problem
The Principal-Agent problem is a specific class of [[Asymmetric Information|asymmetric information problem]] where one entity (the Principal) delegates authority or employs another entity (the Agent) to perform an action on their behalf. The core conflict arises because:
- The interests of the Principal and Agent are not perfectly aligned
- The principle cannot perfectly observe or verify the Agent's effort or information.

**Dynamics**
- **Goal Misalignment:** The Principal typically desires maximum effort or profit maximization, while the Agent often seeks to minimize effort (utility cost of labor) or maximize personal benefits.
- **Incentive Compatibility:** Solutions require designing contracts where the Agent's optimal strategy yields the outcome desired by the Principal, often through performance-based pay or partial risk-sharing.
