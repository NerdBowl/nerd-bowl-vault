### Commitment Devices
**Commitment Devices** are mechanisms or strategic moves that alter a player's available options or payoffs to make a promise or threat **credible**. They address **Commitment Problems**, where players would collectively benefit from a specific outcome but individual incentives lead to defection.
#### Credible vs. Non-Credible Threats
- **Non-Credible Threat:** A threat that a rational player would not carry out because it is not in their material interest to do so when the time comes.
- **Credible Threat:** A threat that the opponent believes will be carried out because the threatener's incentives have been altered (or constrained) to make carrying out the threat optimal or unavoidable.
#### Schelling’s Insight (Limiting Options)
Economist Thomas Schelling demonstrated that voluntarily **limiting one's own options** can be strategically advantageous .
- **The Logic:** By removing the option to "defect" or "back down," a player changes the expectations of their opponent.
- **The Kidnapper Parable:** A kidnapper wants to release a victim but fears the victim will go to the police. The victim cannot _credibly_ promise silence because, once free, they have no incentive to keep the promise .
- **The Solution:** The victim provides evidence of a "blackmailable act" (a commitment device) to the kidnapper. This creates a bond: if the victim goes to the police, the kidnapper releases the blackmail. This aligns the victim's incentives with silence, making the promise credible and allowing for their release .
#### Psychological Commitment
In the absence of physical or material commitment devices, **psychological preferences** can serve as commitment devices. If a person is known to feel significant guilt or psychological cost from breaking a promise, their threat/promise becomes credible even if it contradicts material self-interest .
